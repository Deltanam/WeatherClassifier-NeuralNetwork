# WeatherClassifier-NeuralNetwork

This is the Python code for a Weather Classifying neural network using the Tensorflow machine learning library/platform.

The neural network type is a Convolutional Neural Network, which is specially designed to classify images into different categories.
The training dataset for this network can be found attached to the research paper: "Multi-class weather recognition from still image using heterogeneous ensemble method."
The final architecture of the network is: 32x(3x3) convolution layer, then 64x(3x3) convolution latter, a flatten layer, and a final pair of 64 and 4-neuron dense layers.

A report, submitted for the class, labelled "ENEL 525 - Final Report" is attached which explains the design in detail.

This was designed as the final project for ENEL 525 - Machine Learning for Engineers
